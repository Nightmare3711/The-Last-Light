# NightmaresTMod
Nightmer's TMod, a standalone mod for Terraria and tModLoader


This mod adds some things to Terraria, all of which are W.I.P. items that currently don't do much. There are new weapons (Most are melee), new armor sets, new ores, and a few new tiles. There's a lot that's planned to be introduced on top of what's already in it, but there's enough in it right now that it might be worth getting.

There are plenty of broken things in the mod, such as the Nightwing and the Tome of Nightmares. Keep in mind that the mod is in its early stages and has a long way to go.
